# PlantLeaf-classification-using-YOLOv8
I recently applied the YOLOv8 model for a plant leaf classification project, leveraging its state-of-the-art object detection capabilities. This approach enabled highly accurate classification of plant species by analyzing leaf characteristics. The results were promising and demonstrated the power of advanced machine learning models in agricultural and environmental applications. Excited to explore more opportunities in AI-driven solutions for sustainable development!
